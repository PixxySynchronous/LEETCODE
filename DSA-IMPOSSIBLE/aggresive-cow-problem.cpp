// Problem statement
// You are given an array 'arr' consisting of 'n' integers which denote the position of a stall.



// You are also given an integer 'k' which denotes the number of aggressive cows.



// You are given the task of assigning stalls to 'k' cows such that the minimum distance between any two of them is the maximum possible.



// Print the maximum possible minimum distance.



// Example:
// Input: 'n' = 3, 'k' = 2 and 'arr' = {1, 2, 3}

// Output: 2

// Explanation: The maximum possible minimum distance will be 2 when 2 cows are placed at positions {1, 3}. Here distance between cows is 2.

//Still dont understand the possiblesol logic. Will need to understadn later with a fresher mind. Did understand why we needed to sort the array and the search space.those two ideas i came up with on my own. However i could not think of the logic of possiblesol even though i knew i had to implement that method.
