//the whole solution was thought of by me. Since i knew, however, to use binary search, it made the time complexity constraint practically useless. I needed help with the out of bounds cases via gpt as i did not think of them myself. ANd also the break line was essential as at that time we had already found the answer. That too was given by gpt.
